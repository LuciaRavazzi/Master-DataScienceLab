# Time series forecasting project

Time series forecasting could be an effective set of techniques to predict future values of every sequential data set. In this porject, at least one ARIMA, UCM and neural network algorithm are implemented in order to predict electric data. 

The repository is made of: <br>
- Codice: it is divided into two folders which contain the code about ARIMA and UCM models, written in R, and the neural networks algorithms, written in python. <br>
- Elaborato.pdf: report.<br>
- Presentazione.pdf: presentation for the exam. <br>
- SDMTSA_852646_1.csv:  predictions of two months ahead obtained with the best models.
